//! Information Memory.
//! [INFO_MEM_SIZE] bytes of non-volatile memory.
//!
//! A single instance of [InfoMemory] is returned by [`Pmm::new()`](crate::pmm::Pmm::new()).
//! 
//! Because the information memory has write protection, access is managed via a write method.
//! 
//! For convenience there is also a method [`InfoMemory::into_unprotected()`] that disables write protection 
//! and returns the infomation memory directly as an array instead.
