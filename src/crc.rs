//! Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).
//!
//! The CRC module produces a signature for a given sequence of data values.
//! The CRC signature is based on the polynomial given in the CRC-CCITT standard: f(x) = x<sup>16</sup> + x<sup>12</sup> + x<sup>5</sup> + 1.
//!
//! To prepare the CRC module, call [`Crc::new()`] and provide the initial output 'seed' value.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! The CRC-CCITT standard assumes that bit 0 of each byte is the Most Significant bit (MSb).
//! This runs counter to most microcontroller architectures (including the MSP430), where bit 0 is the Least Significant bit (LSb).
//! To account for this, the MSP430 has bit-reversal hardware which can reverse the order of bits in CRC inputs or outputs. The functions
//! that reverse the bit order are suffixed with `_lsb`, whereas the functions that do not reverse the bit order end in `_msb`.
//!
//! Unless you have recieved already bit-reversed values from an external source, or have bit-reversed them yourself, you probably want to use the `_lsb`  
//! insertion functions and the regular result function.
//!
