# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Unreleased
- The library now requires specifying a device feature (e.g. `msp430fr2355`) as part of the process to support more devices. Users must enable exactly one device feature that matches the device being targetted.
- The underlying PAC version has been bumped to 0.6, which now uses svd2rust 0.37.1. This has changed the capitalisation of peripheral instances from `SCREAMING_CASE` to `snake_case`, e.g.`periph.WDT_A` is now `periph.wdt_a`. Peripheral type names have also changed case, and underscores have been omitted, e.g. `E_USCI_A0` is now `EUsciA0`.
- Add initial support for the MSP430FR2433
- The `REFOCLK` and `VLOCLK` constants have been renamed to the more descriptive `REFOCLK_FREQ_HZ` and `VLOCLK_FREQ_HZ`.
- The frequency of MODCLK is now exported through the `MODCLK_FREQ_HZ` constant.
- Batch GPIO configuration now supports configuring pins to alternate modes
- Added Batch GPIO methods to set all pins in a port as inputs with either pullups or pulldowns. Useful for minimising power usage on unused pins, as leaving them in the default floating state can waste a lot of power through noise-induced schmitt trigger activations.
- Refactors to the Information Memory interface:
  - Rather than `InfoMemory::as_x()` methods consuming the `pac::Sys` register block, the new `hal::take()` method which returns the PAC peripherals and an instance of `InfoMemory`.
  - `InfoMemory` now offers two modes of operation: The information memory is normally write protected, but `.write()` takes a closure where the info memory's write protection is temporarily disabled. Alternatively, `.into_unprotected()` disables the write protection entirely and returns a mutable reference to the underlying array.
- The `pac::Sys` register block is now consumed by `Pmm::new()`. The `SYSCFGx` registers are touched internally by several peripherals in the HAL, but there was previously no mechanism to prevent users from accidentally modifying these registers afterwards. An instance of `pac::Sys` can be constructed unsafely using `pac::Sys::steal()` if it is required, but it is up to the user to ensure that control bits used by the HAL are not modified.
- Fixed linker error "undefined reference to `__mspabi_func_epilog`" by linking lgcc last in `.cargo/config.toml`.

## [v0.5.0] - 2025-10-30

### Additions
- Add support for low power modes
- Add SPI slave support. This includes modifying SPI configuration flow and `SpiErr`.
- Add support for I2C multi-master, slave, and master-slave roles.
- Add support for Smart Analog Combo and Enhanced Comparator modules (MSP430FR23xx only)
- Add support for reading from / writing to backup memory and information memory
- Add support for hardware CRC module
- Add implementations for embedded-hal 1.0 traits (including embedded-io and embedded-hal-nb).
- Support for delays when using sub-1MHz clock sources (e.g. ACLK, VLOCLK).
- Add methods to enable the internal voltage reference and temperature sensor.
- Add additional generic delay implementations for eh-0.2.7 DelayMs trait (u8, u32, i32).
- Derive `Debug` and `Copy` for `RecvError`.

### Changes
- MSRV updated to nightly-2023-09-01 (1.82) due to `msp430-rt` 0.4.1.
- Gate embedded-hal 0.2.7 implementations behind `embedded-hal-02` feature.
- Expose functionality from the traits dropped between eh-0.2.7 and eh-1.0 (ADC, timers, RTC, watchdog, etc.) as methods on structs instead.
- The SPI struct has been renamed from `SpiBus` to `Spi` to avoid naming conflicts with the new embedded-hal 1.0 trait `SpiBus`.
- Ensure crate builds successfully back to `nightly-2023-09-01`.
- Replace public references to `void::Void` with `core::convert::Infallible`.

### Bugfixes
- Fix SPI flushing bug.
- Fix GPIO pins labelled with incorrect SPI functionality for eUSCI A0 and A1.
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause an infinite loop during clock configuration (same bug mentioned in v0.4.0).
- Bring I2C implementation inline with the contracts mentioned in embedded-hal.
